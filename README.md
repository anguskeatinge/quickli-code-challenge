# Task

Build a YTD calculator

## Why

This is one of our most requested features, it saves brokers having to change platforms to do these numbers.
It also allows us to build in more policy into our platform.

## Requirements

I'm deliberately going light on the instructions with this task. I want to see what you come up with.

Please don't spend more than 3 hours working on this. Although if you have to spend some time reading up front, that's fine.

The calculation itself should happen on the backend (e.g. /api/ytd) and the frontend should update in real time.

Technology to use:

- next (fullstack react framework)
- typescript (preferred but optional)
- mui (component library)
- swr (data fetching)
- date-fns (date stuff)
- useState (state management)

## Submission

Commit your work to github and send me a link

## Notes

- feel free to clone a starter project from mui or next to kickstart the project (e.g. [nextjs-with-typescript](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs-with-typescript))
- feel free to use a form library like formik or react-hook-form but imo it is overkill for this
- feel free to revert to plain js if you're uncomfortable with Typescript
- hit me up if you have any questions, I hope you enjoy!
